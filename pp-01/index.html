    <h1>Why Roboto and Rokkitt Pair Well</h1>
    <p>Roboto has always been a typeface I enjoyed using. From my personal projects to school work, Roboto was always a go-to for me because of how simple and sleek of a typeface it is. This is thanks to its "friendly and open curves" along with allowing "letters to be settled into their natural width". For a good pairing, I ended up choosing Rokkitt. Rokkitt is described as having "distinctive geometric slab serifs". This makes it pair very well with the monotone and sleek Roboto typeface as per the "Embrace the Other" technique. As is seen in this page, the typeface paring is very good.</p>
