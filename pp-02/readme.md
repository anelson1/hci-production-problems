## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=12Q0u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: Green is commonly associated with video games. By using different shades of green, we can draw attention to different parts of the page while keeping the overall "gaming" theme. 

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=51s0u0ktHwoitFynHzMwZq9B1kB
Your Rationale: When I think of spring, I think yellows and oranges (as it paints pictures of flowers blooming and trees growing). By using this palette, the bright theme of spring can be conveyed. 

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=3050u0kySwgkpDRpX-5-Vp6FgjG
Your Rationale: I went with very bright colors to draw and keep the child's attention while picking primary colors to give a sense of simplicity. 

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=c4L3+4z4e0kkUn6aCzUg0sapiiQuHdi
Your Rationale: I went with a modified adjacent palette of purples and blues. When I think of cybersecurity (or security in general) I think of blue and purple as a way to convey safety while also knowledge.
