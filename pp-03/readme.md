## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidelines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/buttons/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I modeled the buttons after the design mantra: "Create button content that helps people instantly understand what the button does". The arrow is a very clear indicator that they should move onto the next step/have their account created.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/data-entry/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I modeled some of the data entry field off of the mantra :When possible, present choices". By presenting dropdowns for state, the input on the user is lessened.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/branding/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The MCA in the original webpage was small and tended to get in the way, especially on the mobile site. I moved it to the top to keep it out of the way and follow the branding guidelines set out by apple.

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
